# Embedding-and-Prediction-newtworks
In this project i've implemented 2 networks and used a Tennis matche and outcome dataset . The first network is the Embedding network, which trained to predict a single outcome, given two tennis players, in order to learn how to represent a player using a vector. The second network is Prediction network - given two tennis player, this network predicts who is about to win. Each player is represented by a vector that is learned by the embedding network.
